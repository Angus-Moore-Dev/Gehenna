Gehenna is a Free and Open-Source Forum centred around the discussion of learning. This is so that people can chat about learning, projects they're partaking in, interesting topics of discussion and free communication between people who want to learn and grow. Everything from computer science, business, art, sports, academia; anything is allowed to be discussed here, so long as it's about learning and some form of personal/product development.

It operates very similarly to other forums, with users, moderators and admins. However in this instance, moderators are subject matter experts or educators, so they are able to endorse answers from users, especially relating to questions. There is a typical forum style system, but then also the QnA component for direct questions with problems that people are facing, quite like the StackOverflow.
